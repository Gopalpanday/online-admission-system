<p><strong>2. What are the deadlines for submitting all of my application materials?</strong></p>
<p>If you're applying as a freshman for early decision admission, the deadline is November 1. Regular decision freshman applicants need to have all application materials to online admission by January 2. If you're applying as a transfer student, the filing period for spring transfer admission is September 1 – October 3, and the filing period for fall transfer admission is February 1 – March 1.</p>

<p><strong>3. May I apply to more than one college?</strong></p>
<p>Online Admission offers first-year applicants for undergraduate admission the option of applying to a primary and an alternate-choice college, recognizing that admission undergraduate colleges and schools offer a multitude of distinctive academic programs, and that many applicants have diverse intellectual interests that may be satisfied by more than one college or school. Applicants using the primary/alternate admission option must satisfy the application requirements for both colleges, including submitting a college interest essay for both colleges. Only exceptional candidates with a serious intellectual passion satisfied by the alternate college or school will be considered for admission by the alternate college.</p>

<p><strong>4. How do I decide which college would be best for me?</strong></p>
<p>Probably the best way is to relate your academic strengths and interests to the degree requirements of the various colleges and the types of majors and courses they offer. (The Courses of Study catalog shows degree requirements for each college.) Sometimes prospective applicants can make reasonable choices by having clearly defined career objectives, but even when such goals are known, the graduation requirements of what appears to be the appropriate college should closely match your academic interests and strengths.

We also encourage you to read online admission publications; to talk with our alumni and students, and with members of our staff; to visit the campus; and to learn as much as possible so you can decide which college would be the best match for you. In addition, please understand that you aren't "stuck" with your choice of a college after you enroll at online admission. Our elective system allows you to sample courses in the other colleges, and about 10 percent of online admission students transfer each year to a different college at online admission.</p>

<p><strong>5. Which college at online admission will offer me the best chance of admission?</strong></p>
<p>That's not really an appropriate question. If you apply to a particular college solely on the basis of its acceptance rate, the chances are good that the selection process will work against you. It will be more difficult to show logical reasoning for making your application to a particular program or major. During selection, all seven undergraduate units carefully evaluate the "match" between an applicant's academic interests and the college(s) to which he or she is applying. If you do not seem to be a good match for your chosen college(s), you risk being refused.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6. What are the GPA and SAT/ACT cutoffs for admission?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have any. Unlike some state university systems, online admission does not use any single formula for its admission decisions. In fact, the whole process can be very subjective. First and foremost, we look at your high school record, the rigor of your coursework, your grades, and your rank-in-class (don't worry if your school doesn't rank – that's quite common). The personal application you write (essays, extracurriculars, etc.) is also a very important piece of online admission's selection process. Standardized testing plays a role, but probably not as much as you think. From there, we rely on a lot of tools that can't be quantified: recommendations, for example, and interviews (required for architecture and hotel applicants). Since all of these pieces help inform our decisions, we can't point to any master chart of GPA and test scores and automatically tell you what the decision will be. And frankly, we like it that way, because it allows us to learn as much as we can about each of our applicants.</p>
